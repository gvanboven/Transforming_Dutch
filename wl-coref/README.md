## wl-coref
This directory contains the code for the wl-coref model by Dobrovolskii (2021) : https://github.com/vdobrovolskii/wl-coref. The code was directly copied, with some small adaptations for the Dutch data marked in the files.

I added the following scripts to this directory:
* `eval.sh`
* `finetune.sh`
* `full_eval.sh`
* `full_evaluation.py` #to evaluate the pronoun scores after training a model
* `train.sh`
